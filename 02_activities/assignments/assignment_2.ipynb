The solution also handles edge cases like empty or single-node trees, making it robust for most scenarios.\n",

Since the solution uses recursion, it might run into problems with very large trees because Python has a limit on how many times a function can call itself. Maybe by changing the code to use a loop and a queue instead of recursion would make it work better for bigger trees. Also, the error message for invalid inputs could be made easier to understand, like saying \"Tree is too small or empty to contain duplicates\" instead of the current message. This would make the code clearer and more user-friendly."
